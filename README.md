### XINASE is not a search engine

XINASE is an open index of pages from across the web. Instead of crawling through hypertext based
on links, it only indexes pages that its users direct it to. XINASE aims to build a better 
alternative to web search by cutting through the cruft of junk results and bringing focus to real
information.
